The AI-powered Performance Analyzer for OS Processes is a next-generation tool designed to provide real-time insights into the performance of operating system (OS) processes. This intelligent solution makes use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to monitor system behaviour, identify potential bottlenecks, detect anomalies, suggest optimizations, recommend improvements and predict future resource usage. The tool bridges the gap between manual system monitoring and advanced AI-driven system analysis, providing greater efficiency and practical insights to optimize and enhance system performance.

1. Features of the AI-Powered Analyzer:
    1.	Real-Time Monitoring:
        o	Collects live data on system processes and resource utilization.
        o	Tracks key metrics like CPU load, memory usage, disk read/write speeds, and network bandwidth.
    2.	Bottleneck Detection:
        o	Applies predefined thresholds (e.g., CPU > 80%, Disk > 90%) to highlight critical resource consumption.
        o	Reports resource-intensive processes, allowing users to take corrective actions.
    3.	Anomaly Detection:
        o	Uses statistical models like Z-scores to detect outliers and resource usage spikes.
        o	Captures events such as unexpected CPU surges, disk activity spikes, or sudden memory leaks.
    4.	Optimization Suggestions:
        o	Offers AI-based recommendations for minimizing resource utilization.
        o	Examples: Adjusting process priorities, freeing up memory, reducing redundant tasks, or deferring non-essential I/O operations.
    5.	Resource Forecasting:
        o	Employs machine learning techniques (e.g., Linear Regression) to predict future CPU, memory, or disk usage trends.
        o	Alerts users in advance about potential resource shortages.
    6.	Visualization and Reporting:
        o	Generates visual dashboards to present historical trends, live metrics, and forecasts.
        o	Includes graphs, charts, and correlation plots (e.g., CPU vs. memory usage).
        o	Exports performance summaries as CSV or PDF for reporting purposes.

The working of AI-powered analyzer id as follows:
    •	Data Collection: The monitoring module captures real-time OS data using libraries like psutil to extract CPU, memory, disk, and network statistics. This data is stored in memory or as files for analysis.
    •	Analysis: An AI module processes the data using machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies, identify bottlenecks, and predict future trends. Threshold rules and AI models ensure comprehensive insights.
    •	Optimization & Reporting: Based on analyzed insights, the tool suggests process-specific or system-wide optimizations. Results are visualized in interactive dashboards or exported as reports.

Components
The project can be divided into three major components:
    1.	Monitoring Module:
        o	Collects live system data.
        o	Tracks and logs resource utilization at process and system levels.
